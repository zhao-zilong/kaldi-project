The optional-silence phone sil occupies 45.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 88.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 39.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.2 hours of data, or 1.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 12.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (45,45.6,81)
