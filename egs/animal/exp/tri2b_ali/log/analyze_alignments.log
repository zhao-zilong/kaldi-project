The optional-silence phone sil occupies 41.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 35.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 12.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (41,41.5,72)
