At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (237,237.0,237) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (157,157.0,157) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 78.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,7.7,13) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (157,525.7,237) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, a_E accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, g_B accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, l_I accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.0,13) frames.
Overall, r_I accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, s_I accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, v_I accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,9.0,9) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 94.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 76.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 93.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 8.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (157,1183.0,157)
