The optional-silence phone sil occupies 41.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 36.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.5 hours of data, or 0.9 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 12.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (43,44.0,76)
