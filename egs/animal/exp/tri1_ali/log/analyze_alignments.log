The optional-silence phone sil occupies 43.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 38.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 12.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (45,44.7,74)
